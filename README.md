# AI core algorithms

This entire repository is dedicated to core AI algorithms.

1. **TSP**: here is a solution to the TSP using various artificial intelligence methods. You will find here:

- DFS/BFS
- NN/KNN
- A* (with optimal and non-optimal heuristics)
- ant colony

2. **Genetic_Algorithm**: In this folder you will find the use of a genetic algorithm to create work schedules.

3. **PSO**: Particle Swarm Optimization for finding the minimum of f(x,y).
