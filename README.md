# AI core algorithms

This entire repository is dedicated to core AI algorithms.

1. **TSP**: here is a solution to the TSP using various artificial intelligence methods. You will find here:

  - DFS
  - BFS
  - NN
  - KNN
  - A* (with optimal and non-optimal heuristics)
  - ant colony

  Note: Before executing any of the above algorithms, execute "Generating distance matrix".
